# Drillstring: Soft String Model

Rotational vibration dynamics are predicted with a soft string model that is broken into individual string segments that include rotational inertia, frictional, and spring effects. The combination of the individual segments may be used to predict rotational vibration. Stick slip is simulated with bit boundary conditions that simulate periods of stuck bit followed by a rapid release of the stored potential energy. A soft string model does not include the effects of borehole interaction with the drill string. The drill string rotation effect is modeled as multiple mass-spring-dampers. See pages 73-74 of Asgharzadeh Shishavan [1] for a description of the model equations and variables.
